# Graph Neural Networks for Channel Decoding

Implementation of the graph neural network (GNN)-based decoder experiments from
[[A *PLACEHOLDER*]](*PLACEHOLDER*) using the
[Sionna link-level simulator](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/).

## Abstract

In this work, we propose a fully differentiable graph neural network (GNN)-based framework for channel decoding and showcase a competitive decoding performance for various coding schemes, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) and BCH codes with significantly less decoding iterations. The idea is to let an NN learn a generalized message passing algorithm over a given graph, representing the FEC code structure, by replacing node and edge message updates with trainable functions. Contrary to many other deep learning-based decoding approaches, the proposed solution enjoys scalability to arbitrary block lengths and the training is not limited by the curse of dimensionality. We benchmark our proposed decoder against state-of-the-art in conventional channel decoding as well as against recent deep learning-based results. For the (63,45) BCH code, our solution outperforms weighted belief propagation (BP) decoding by approximately 0.5dB and even for 5G NR LDPC codes, we observe a competitive performance when compared to conventional BP decoding. For the BCH codes, the resulting GNN decoder can be fully parametrized with only 9900 weights.

## Setup

Running this code requires [Sionna 0.10](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/).
To run the notebooks on your machine, you also need [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
We recommend Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8, and TensorFlow 2.8.

## Structure of this repository

The following notebooks may serve as starting point:

* [GNN_decoder_standalone.ipynb](GNN_decoder_standalone.ipynb) : Implements a standalone tutorial-style GNN-based decoder. This notebook can be directly executed in Google Colab. Please note that for the sake of simplicity not all functions of the library are available; please use the notebooks below for more sophisticated experiments.
* [GNN_decoder_universal.ipynb](GNN_decoder_universal.ipynb) : Implements a universal GNN-based decoder that can be configured for own experiments.
* [GNN_decoder_BCH.ipynb](GNN_decoder_BCH.ipynb) : Trains the GNN-decoder for the (63,45) BCH code. Reproduces Fig. 3 in [[A *PLACEHOLDER*]](*PLACEHOLDER*)
* [GNN_decoder_reg_LDPC.ipynb](GNN_decoder_reg_LDPC.ipynb) : Trains the GNN-decoder for regular (3,6) LDPC codes. Reproduces Fig. 4 in [[A *PLACEHOLDER*]](*PLACEHOLDER*)
* [GNN_decoder_LDPC_5G.ipynb](GNN_decoder_LDPC_5G.ipynb) : Trains the GNN-decoder to decode 5G NR LDPC codes. Reproduces Fig. 5 in [[A *PLACEHOLDER*]](*PLACEHOLDER*)

These notebooks rely on the following modules:

* [gnn.py](gnn.py) : Implements the GNN-based decoder and utility functions.
* [wbp.py](wbp.py) : Implements the weighted BP decoder and training for comparison [[B]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04793). See [Sionna example notebook](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/examples/Weighted_BP_Algorithm.html) for further details.

In addition, pre-trained weights are available in the [weights/](weights/) directory. This allows reproducing the results from [[A *PLACEHOLDER*]](*PLACEHOLDER*) without retraining the neural network. The result of each simulation can be found in [results/](results/).
